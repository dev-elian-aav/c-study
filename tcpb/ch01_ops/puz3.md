# Login and Increment Operators

* Operators 3.1: 1. Good
* Operators 3.2: 0. Wrong
* Operators 3.3: ´´´x = 2, z = 1´´´. Good then Wrong
* Operators 3.4: ´´´x = 3, z = 2´´´. Good then Wrong
* Operators 3.5: 0. Wrong

* Operators 3.1: So it will return 1 because x and y exist, it will not check if z exists since
it stops checking as soon as the truth or falsehood of the statement is known.
* Operators 3.2: I think it's zero because of ´´´! y && z´´´ since y exists, and ´´´&&´´´
has higher precedence than ´´´||´´´. (It wasn't)
* I have to read Chapter 2 of K&R.
