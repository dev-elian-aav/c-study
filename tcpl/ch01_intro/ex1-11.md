# Exercise 1-11
* I would test the program with numbers and escape sequences like \b and \0.
* I wouldn't test it by putting a ton of blanks in a row, as the program isn't written
for pruning input like ex1-09.
* Even if I do that, it wouldn't count a word, since state would be OUT, as it should.
* If I type \b\b\b \b\b\b\n it would wrongly count two words.
* Inputing a ton of characters (letters) withouth spaces would only cound as one word.
* Sending the EOF signal as soon as the program starts would end in a 0 0 0 output, which is correct.
