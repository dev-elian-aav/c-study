# Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
## 1.1 Getting Started

[QUESTIONS]

1. How related are C and C++?
2. How the C compiler, written in C, was compiled in the first place?
3. Why the introduction separates OSes from "major programs"?
4. What's the size of C variable types now?
5. What are the use cases of ´´´while´´´ and ´´´for´´´?
6. When should be ´´´for´´´ used instead of ´´´while´´´ and viceversa?
7. If the choice between ´´´while´´´ and ´´´for´´´ is arbitrary, Why include them both in the language?
8. What is the precedence of operators?
9. Are long and short useless types as of now?

[ANSWERS]

6. *"The choice between ´´´while´´´ and ´´´for´´´ is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer"* - Kernighan and Ritchie

[NOTES]

* C is a typed programming language.
* C is a low level language.
* C programs are comprised of functions and variables.
* Every program must have a "main" function somewhere.
* Functions are comprised of statements.
* The list of values provided to a function are called arguments.
* () besides a function means a empty list, the function expects no arguments.
* character string: sequence of characters inside double quotes.
* printf never supplies a newline character.
* escape sequence: general and extensible mechanism to write hard-to-type/invisible characters.
* All variables in C have to be declared before they are used.
* ´´´while´´´: test condition -> condition is true -> execute statements inside the loop.
* ´´´while´´´: test condition -> condition is false -> execute statements after the loop.
* Indentation and spacing are for better readability of the code.
* Integer division truncates in C. (Not special to C though)
* If you can pass the value of a variable, you can pass a expression of the same type.
* A ´´´for´´´ loop consist of three parts: The initialization, the condition and the step.
* Magic numbers: numbers that you can't easily know what they are for,
and are a pain to change if used repeatedly in a program.
* Convention: Symbolic constant names are written in uppercase.
* int can hold more data than char.
* Assignments can be part of larger expressions.
* ´´´for´´´ loops can be empty if the work is done in the test and step parts.
* Condition evaluation stops as soon as it's truth or falsehood is known.
* *"The output of this program on itself is..."* **always** make sure to read **everything**.
* Conditions are evaluated in **order**.
